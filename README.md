Protein-patterning has emerged as a powerful tool to interrogate adherent cells. Yet, there are no standard tools of fabrication, or analysis of the response of the cell to a spatially periodic stimulus. We propose a technique combining electron-beam lithography and surface functionalization to fabricate nano-patterns compatible with advanced imaging. The regularity of the pattern is exploited by a deep-learning algorithm to reveal that T cells organize their actin network differently on patterned or homogeneously stimulating substrates - an effect invisible to the unassisted human eye even after extensive image analysis. Our integrated fabrication and analysis tool-box should be useful for exploring general correlation between a spatially-structured stimulation and the cellular response.
